# 🎧 Demond’s Beat Lab

Welcome to my personal beat-making showcase! This site highlights my creative process using FL Studio, where I turn samples into full tracks. Built entirely with Bootstrap, it demonstrates how modern frameworks can speed up development while keeping design flexible and responsive.

## 🎨 Custom CSS

All layout, spacing, and responsiveness handled with Bootstrap utilities.

## 🧠 Reflection  

### Most Challenging Component  
**Audio embedding**: Managing filenames with spaces and special characters required careful path handling and testing across browsers.

### Easiest Component  
**Toast**: Bootstrap handled all the logic—just a few attributes and it worked perfectly.

### How Bootstrap Helped  
It sped up layout and responsiveness, reduced my CSS file size, and kept my code clean and maintainable.

### Likes & Dislikes  
✅ Loved the utility classes and responsive grid  
❌ Disliked how cluttered HTML can get with too many utility classes
