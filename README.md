# 🎧 Demond’s Beat Lab

Welcome to my personal beat-making showcase! This site highlights my creative process using FL Studio, where I turn samples into full tracks. Built entirely with Bootstrap, it demonstrates how modern frameworks can speed up development while keeping design flexible and responsive.

You can preview a few of my original beats directly on the site. Each one was created in FL Studio using chopped samples, layered drums, and custom effects. The audio players are embedded using HTML5 and styled with Bootstrap cards and modals.

## 🧩 Bootstrap Components Used
- **Carousel** – Showcases beat thumbnails and sample pack covers
- **Modal** – Opens a popup to preview a beat
- **Accordion** – Breaks down my FL Studio workflow
- **Dropdown** – Lets users select favorite genres
- **Toast** – Confirms contact form submission

## 🎨 Custom CSS
Only used for:
- Font sizing and header styling
- Custom color palette to match my beat-making vibe

All layout, spacing, and responsiveness handled with Bootstrap utilities.

## 🧠 Reflection

### Most Challenging Component
**Scrollspy** (optional): It required precise setup and was tricky to get working smoothly across screen sizes.

### Easiest Component
**Modal**: Bootstrap handled all the logic—just a few attributes and it worked perfectly.

### How Bootstrap Helped
It sped up layout and responsiveness, reduced my CSS file size, and kept my code clean and maintainable.

### Likes & Dislikes
✅ Loved the utility classes and responsive grid  
❌ Disliked how cluttered HTML can get with too many utility classes
