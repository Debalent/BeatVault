# Demond’s Beat Lab

Welcome to my personal beat-making showcase. This site highlights my creative process using FL Studio, where I turn samples into full tracks. Built entirely with Bootstrap, it demonstrates how modern frameworks can speed up development while keeping design flexible and responsive.

## Featured Beats  
You can preview six original beats directly on the site. Each one was created in FL Studio using chopped samples, layered drums, and custom effects. Audio players are embedded using HTML5 and styled with Bootstrap grid layout. A shared thumbnail image is used for each beat and also serves as the site logo.

## Bootstrap Components Used  
- Accordion – Breaks down my FL Studio workflow  
- Dropdown – Lets users select favorite genres  
- Toast – Confirms contact form submission  
- Navbar – Includes logo and navigation links  
- Grid System – Organizes beat previews responsively

---

## Custom CSS  
Only used for:  
- Font sizing and header styling  
- Custom color palette to match my beat-making vibe  
- Beat title formatting and audio spacing  

All layout, spacing, and responsiveness handled with Bootstrap utilities.

## Reflection

### Most Challenging Component  
**Audio embedding**: Managing filenames with spaces and special characters required careful path handling and testing across browsers.

### Easiest Component  
**Toast**: Bootstrap handled all the logic—just a few attributes and it worked perfectly.

### How Bootstrap Helped  
It sped up layout and responsiveness, reduced my CSS file size, and kept my code clean and maintainable.

### Likes & Dislikes  
- Loved the utility classes and responsive grid  
- Disliked how cluttered HTML can get with too many utility classes
